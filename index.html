        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[9] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[10] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[11] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.<p>

            <h3>Personal life</h3>
            <p>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[613] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[614] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[615]

<p><strong>"Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved."</strong></p>

— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 5] who addressed Messi's growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.
Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[617] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[618] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[619] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[620] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[621] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.</p>
